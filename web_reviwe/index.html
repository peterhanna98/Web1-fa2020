    <p>
        Internet is a huge power now days. I think is very helpful to all people old and young. 
        Me personally can’t live a day without internet. I do all my work and search using internet. 
        Internet gives us a huge favor and give us the ability to connect to each other even if we 
        really far away. A great example in the situation that we are in now (coronavirus) I don’t 
        think if we don’t have internet will be able to have our classes online or even know what 
        is happening around us. So, I feel internet took a really good position on our life. I never 
        think how people lived without internet but, when I think about it, I really ask my self was 
        it boring back than how they search or know what is going on around them without this huge power. 
        In addition, now everything I can think of are working using internet. Also, me as a UX/Ui and 
        graphic designer using a lot of softwires and programs, I feel without internet I wouldn’t be able 
        to do my work. So, we come to the conclusion that internet is a huge power to everyone and great 
        opportunity that we have it in our life.
